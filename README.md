PYTHON PROGRAMMING EXCERSIZES - Academic ===================\n
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n

This is just a collection of academic programming examples in python.\n
Most of this code is available elsewhere on the web, but I have collected them as I do the exercises to keep the basics fresh.\n
Feel free to use as needed, as the original authors have long been unknown.\n
